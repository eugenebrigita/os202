# Top 10 List of Week 09

1. [Mass Storage Structure](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/Mass-Storage-Management)<br>
Each modern disk contains concentric tracks and each track is divided into multiple sectors. 
The disks are usually arranged as a one dimensional array of blocks, where blocks are the 
smallest storage unit.Blocks can also be called as sectors. For each surface of the disk, 
there is a read/write desk available.

2. [HDD Scheduling](http://www.cs.iit.edu/~cs561/cs450/disksched/disksched.html)<br>
Disk Scheduling Algorithms are used to reduce the total seek time of any request.

3. [NVM Scheduling](https://www.deep-projects.eu/hardware/memory-hierarchies/48-nvm)<br>
The NVM device is physically attached to the Booster Nodes (BN) and provides local high-performance data storage.

4. [Error Detection and Correction](https://youtu.be/EMrY-8m8D1E)<br>
This video will explain about transmission errors, types of error, error detection and correction, also about its technique.

5. [Storage Device Management](https://youtu.be/s1MYMTW4iHQ)<br>
This video was made by University of South Carolina and will explain about Storage Device Management in Operating System.

6. [Swap-Space Management](https://youtu.be/BkJ3A6HJkyc)<br>
This video will explain disk management in OS especially about Swap-Space Management and Reliability.

7. [Storage Attachment](http://www.faadooengineers.com/online-study/post/cse/operating-system/275/disk-attachment)<br>
Computers access disk storage in two ways. One way is via I/O ports (or host-attached storage);
this is common on small system. The other way is via a remote host in a distributed file system; 
this is reffered to as network-attached storage.

8. [RAID Structure](https://youtu.be/BZE4cIm23Js)<br>
This video will explain RAID in operating system, general RAID levels, and comparison 
between RAID levels.

RAID is the technique in which we use multiple physical hard-drives together as a single logical hard-drive.
9. [Disk Scheduling Algorithm](https://youtu.be/X63lwwQtpic)<br>
Disk-scheduling algorithms can improve the effective bandwidth of HDDs,
the average response time, and the variance in response time. 
Algorithms such as SCAN and C-SCAN are designed to make such improvements 
through strategies for disk-queue ordering. Performance of diskscheduling 
algorithms can vary greatly on hard disks. In contrast, because
solid-state disks have no moving parts, performance varies little among
scheduling algorithms, and quite often a simple FCFS strategy is used.
URL provided will explain more about this topic, please check it out!

10. [Object Storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10)<br>
Object storage is used for big data problems such as indexing the Internet and 
cloud photo storage. Objects are self-defining collections of data,
addressed by object ID rather than file name. Typically it uses replication
for data protection, computes based on the data on systems where a copy
of the data exists, and is horizontally scalable for vast capacity and easy
expansion.

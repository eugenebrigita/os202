# Top 10 List of Week 07

1. [Race Conditions](https://searchstorage.techtarget.com/definition/race-condition)<br>
A race condition occurs when processes have concurrent access to shared
data and the final result depends on the particular order in which concurrent 
accesses occur. Race conditions can result in corrupted values of shared data.

2. [Critical-Section Problem](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/critical-section-problem)<br>
The critical section is a code segment where the shared variables can be accessed. 
An atomic action is required in a critical section i.e. only one process can execute 
in its critical section at a time. All the other processes have to wait to execute in 
their critical sections.

3. [Critical Section Solutions](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/critical-section-problem)<br>
The critical section problem needs a solution to synchronize the different processes. 
The solution to the critical section problem must satisfy the following conditions:
* Mutual Exclusion implies that only one process can be inside the critical section at any time. 
If any other processes require the critical section, they must wait until it is free.
* Progress means that if a process is not using the critical section, then it should 
not stop any other process from accessing it. In other words, any process can enter a 
critical section if it is free.
* Bounded waiting means that each process must have a limited waiting time. 
It should not wait endlessly to access the critical section.

4. [Process Synchronization](https://my.eng.utah.edu/~cs5460/slides/Lecture07.pdf)<br>
Basic idead behind most synchronization: If two threads, processes, interrupt
handlers, etc. are going to have conflicting accesses, force one of them wait until
it is safe to be proceeded. Synchronization problems are: (1) synchronization can be 
required for different resources (2) there are different kinds of synchronization problems
(3) synchronization may be across machines (4) sometimes it's not OK to block a thread
or process.

5. [Peterson's Solution](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-process-synchronization/)<br>
Petersonâ€™s Solution preserves all three conditions : (1) Mutual Exclusion is assured 
as only one process can access the critical section at any time. (2) Progress is 
also assured, as a process outside the critical section does not block other processes 
from entering the critical section. (3) Bounded Waiting is preserved as every process 
gets a fair chance.

6. [Sempahore](https://www.guru99.com/semaphore-in-operating-system.html)<br>
Semaphore is simply a variable that is non-negative and shared between threads. 
A semaphore is a signaling mechanism, and a thread that is waiting on a semaphore 
can be signaled by another thread. It uses two atomic operations, (1) wait, and 
(2) signal for the process synchronization. A semaphore either allows or disallows 
access to the resource, which depends on how it is set up.

7. [When to call it a Deadlock?](http://kambing.ui.ac.id/bebas/v15/umum/ibam/ibam-os-html/i32.html)<br>
* Mutual Exclusion
* Hold and Wait
* Non-pre-emptive
* Circular Wait
Please check the website to discover deadlock in details.

8. [Deadlock in Java Multithreading](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/Deadlock-in-Java-Multithreading)<br>
A Java multithreaded program may suffer from the deadlock condition because the synchronized 
keyword causes the executing thread to block while waiting for the lock, or monitor, 
associated with the specified object. Please check the website to see example.

9. [Deadlock Handling Method](https://www.javatpoint.com/os-strategies-for-handling-deadlock)<br>
* Deadlock ignorance ignores deadlock. This approach is best suitable for a single end user 
system where User uses the system only for browsing and all other normal stuff.
* Deadlock prevention: Deadlock happens only when Mutual Exclusion, hold and wait, 
No preemption and circular wait holds simultaneously. If it is possible to violate one 
of the four conditions at any time then the deadlock can never occur in the system.
* Deadlock avoidance, the OS reviews each allocation so that the allocation doesn't 
cause the deadlock in the system.
* Deadlock detection and recovery let the processes fall in deadlock and then periodically 
check whether deadlock occur in the system or not. If it occurs then it applies some of the 
recovery methods to the system to get rid of deadlock.

10. [Recovery from Deadlock](http://kambing.ui.ac.id/bebas/v15/umum/ibam/ibam-os-html/i32.html)<br>
* Process Termination: Metode ini akan menghapus proses-proses yang terlibat pada kondisi 
deadlock dengan mengacu pada beberapa syarat. Beberapa syarat yang termasuk dalam metode ini 
adalah, sebagai berikut:
** Menghapus semua proses yang terlibat dalam kondisi deadlock (solusi ini terlalu mahal).
** Menghapus satu persatu proses yang terlibat, sampai kondisi deadlock dapat diatasi (memakan banyak waktu).
** Menghapus proses berdasarkan prioritas, waktu eksekusi, waktu untuk selesai, dan kedalaman dari rollback.
* Resources Preemption: Metode ini lebih menekankan kepada bagaimana menghambat 
suatu proses dan sumber daya, agar tidak terjebak pada unsafe condition
** Pilih salah satu - proses dan sumber daya yang akan di-preempt.
** Rollback ke safe state yang sebelumnya telah terjadi.
** Mencegah suatu proses agar tidak terjebak pada starvation karena metode ini.

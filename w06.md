# Top 10 List of Week 06

1. [Process Concept](https://medium.com/@akhandmishra/operating-system-process-and-process-management-108d83e8ce60)<br>
A process is a program in execution, and the status of the current activity of
a process is represented by the program counter, as well as other registers.

2. [4 General States of Process](http://brahms.emu.edu.tr/filizbilen/OS/Lecture%20Notes-Chapter%202.pdf)<br>
There are four general states of aprocess: (1) ready, (2) running, (3) waiting, and (4) terminated.

3. [The Role of Process Scheduling](https://www.guru99.com/process-scheduling.html)<br>Process Scheduling is an OS task that schedules processes of different states like ready, waiting, and running.
Process scheduling allows OS to allocate a time interval of CPU execution for each process.
Another important reason for using a process scheduling system is that it keeps the CPU busy 
all the time. This allows you to get the minimum response time for programs.

4. [fork() system calls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9seb8hddeK4&list=RDQMGpMl4ZQfZhI&start_radio=1)<br>
This is a youtube playlist contained of plenty videos explained the fork() introcution to related QnA.

5. [pipe() system calls](https://youtu.be/Mqb2dVRe0uo)<br>
This is a youtube video that explained communicating between processes in C using pipes.

6. [Client-Server Communication: Socket](https://youtu.be/uagKTbohimU)<br>
A Unix Socket is used in a client-server application framework. A server is a process 
that performs some functions on request from a client. Most of the application-level protocols 
like FTP, SMTP, and POP3 make use of sockets to establish connection between client and server 
and then for exchanging data. More reading about Socket [here](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix_sockets/what_is_socket.htm).

7. [Thread VS Multithreaded](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/single-threaded-and-multi-threaded-processes#)<br>
Single threaded processes contain the execution of instructions in a single sequence. 
In other words, one command is processes at a time.The opposite of single threaded processes are multithreaded 
processes. These processes allow the execution of multiple parts of a program at the same time. 
These are lightweight processes available within the process.

8. [Benefits of Multithreaded Processes](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/single-threaded-and-multi-threaded-processes#)<br>
* All the threads of a process share its resources such as memory, data, files etc. 
A single application can have different threads within the same address space using 
resource sharing.
* It is more economical to use threads as they share the process resources. Comparatively, 
it is more expensive and time consuming to create processes as they require more memory and 
resources.
* Program responsiveness allows a program to run even if part of it is blocked using multithreading. 
This can also be done if the process is performing a lengthy operation.
* In a multiprocessor architecture, each thread can run on a different processor in parallel 
using multithreading. This increases concurrency of the system. This is in direct contrast to a 
single processor system, where only one process or thread can run on a processor at a time.

9. [Concurrency](https://youtu.be/iKtvNJQoCNw)<br>
This is a youtube video by Mike Swift that covered explanation about the uses of concurrency, sources of concurrency,
scheduler's role in concurrency, real implementation: examples and strategies of concurrency, and the benign
uses of concurrency.

10. [Parallel Computing](https://youtu.be/q7sgzDH1cR8)
Parallel computing is a type of computation where many calculations or the execution of processes are carried out simultaneously.
This is a 3-minutes video explained about parallel computing to help us understand what parallelism is.
